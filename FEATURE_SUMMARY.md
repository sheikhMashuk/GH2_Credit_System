# Green Hydrogen Marketplace - Feature Summary

## Project Overview
Complete Green Hydrogen Credit System with fixed pricing, enhanced user experience, and comprehensive IPFS integration for transparency and immutability.

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Fixed Credit Pricing System ✅
- **Price**: 0.001 ETH per credit (enforced across all components)
- **Smart Contract**: `FIXED_PRICE_PER_CREDIT` constant prevents price manipulation
- **Frontend**: Automatic price calculation and display in ETH and USD
- **Conversion Rate**: $2000/ETH for USD display

### 2. Enhanced Buyer Dashboard ✅
- **Primary Tab**: Purchase History with detailed statistics
  - Success/Failed/Pending transaction counts
  - Total transactions and credits purchased
  - Detailed transaction list with status badges
- **Secondary Tab**: Marketplace listings for browsing
- **Real-time Updates**: Refreshes after purchases

### 3. Click-to-Copy Functionality ✅
- **Transaction Hashes**: Full hash display with one-click copy
- **Wallet Addresses**: From/To addresses with copy buttons
- **Visual Feedback**: Toast notifications and icon changes
- **User Experience**: Eliminates manual hash copying

### 4. Comprehensive IPFS Integration ✅
- **Credit Approval**: Automatic Pinata upload on regulatory approval
- **Credit Sales**: Transfer ownership tracking with metadata updates
- **Credit Listings**: Status updates when credits are listed for sale
- **Status Changes**: All lifecycle events stored immutably
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transparency for all credit transactions

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract (Solidity)
```solidity
contract HydrogenMarketplace {
    uint256 public constant FIXED_PRICE_PER_CREDIT = 1000000000000000; // 0.001 ETH
    
    function purchaseCredits(uint256 listingId, uint256 quantity) 
        external payable {
        require(msg.value == FIXED_PRICE_PER_CREDIT * quantity);
        // Purchase logic
    }
}
```

### Backend Services (Node.js)
- **CreditLifecycleService**: Handles all IPFS updates for credit events
- **MarketplaceController**: Enhanced with IPFS integration for purchases/listings
- **RegulatoryController**: Approval workflow with automatic IPFS storage
- **IPFSService**: Pinata integration with error handling and timeouts

### Frontend Components (React/TypeScript)
- **BuyerDashboard**: Tab-based interface with purchase history priority
- **CreditCard**: Fixed pricing display and MetaMask integration
- **TransactionHistory**: Click-to-copy functionality with visual feedback
- **MarketplaceListingModal**: Simplified interface without price inputs

## User Workflows

### Producer Journey
1. **Registration**: Create account with wallet address
2. **Submission**: Submit production data (quantity generates credits automatically)
3. **Approval**: Wait for regulatory authority verification
4. **Listing**: List approved credits at fixed price (0.001 ETH)
5. **Sale**: Receive payment when buyers purchase credits

### Buyer Journey
1. **Registration**: Create account with wallet address
2. **Browse**: View marketplace listings with fixed pricing
3. **Purchase**: Buy credits using MetaMask (automatic price calculation)
4. **History**: Track purchases in enhanced dashboard with statistics
5. **Copy Details**: Easy access to transaction hashes and addresses

### Regulatory Authority Journey
1. **Registration**: Create regulatory account
2. **Review**: Examine pending producer submissions
3. **Approve**: Verify and approve submissions (triggers IPFS upload)
4. **Monitor**: Track approved credits and marketplace activity

## Data Flow and IPFS Integration

### Credit Approval Flow
```
Producer Submission → Regulatory Review → Approval → IPFS Upload → Credit Generation
```

### Credit Sale Flow
```
Marketplace Listing → IPFS Status Update → Buyer Purchase → IPFS Transfer Record → Ownership Update
```

### IPFS Metadata Structure
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "type": "green-hydrogen-credit",
  "creditId": "CREDIT-001",
  "producer": {
    "address": "0x...",
    "name": "Producer Name"
  },
  "credits": {
    "amount": 100,
    "status": "active|sold|transferred",
    "ownership": {
      "currentOwner": "0x...",
      "transferHistory": [...]
    }
  },
  "verification": {
    "status": "APPROVED",
    "approvedBy": "regulatory-authority"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "lastUpdated": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "standard": "GH2-Credit-v1.0"
  }
}
```

## Security Features

### Blockchain Security
- **Fixed Pricing**: Prevents price manipulation attacks
