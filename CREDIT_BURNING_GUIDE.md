# Green Hydrogen Marketplace - Credit Burning Implementation

## Overview
The Green Hydrogen Marketplace now implements **credit burning** when buyers purchase credits. This ensures that purchased credits are permanently retired and cannot be resold, providing genuine carbon offset benefits.

## Credit Burning Flow

### 1. Purchase Process
When a buyer purchases credits:
1. **Payment**: Buyer pays fixed price (0.001 ETH per credit) via MetaMask
2. **Transfer**: Credits are transferred from producer to buyer on blockchain
3. **Burning**: Credits are immediately burned (permanently retired)
4. **IPFS Storage**: Burn record is stored on Pinata IPFS for immutable proof

### 2. What Happens to Credits
- **Before Purchase**: Credits exist in producer's balance and can be listed for sale
- **After Purchase**: Credits are **burned** and permanently removed from circulation
- **Buyer Benefit**: Buyer receives carbon offset benefit, not transferable credits
- **Immutable Record**: Burn details stored permanently on IPFS

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### Credit Lifecycle Service (`credit-lifecycle.service.js`)
```javascript
async handleCreditTransfer(creditId, fromAddress, toAddress, amount, transferType = 'sale') {
  // Creates burned credit data for IPFS storage
  const burnedCreditData = {
    version: '1.0',
    type: 'green-hydrogen-credit-burned',
    creditId: creditId,
    originalProducer: { address: fromAddress, name: producerName },
    buyer: { address: toAddress, name: buyerName },
    burnDetails: {
      originalCredits: submission.credits,
      creditsBurned: amount,
      burnedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      burnReason: 'Credit purchase and consumption',
      purchasePrice: amount * 0.001, // ETH
      purchasePriceUSD: amount * 0.001 * 2000
    },
    verification: {
      burnStatus: 'BURNED_AND_CONSUMED',
      burnedBy: toAddress
    }
  };
  
  // Store burned credit data to IPFS
  const ipfsHash = await IPFSService.updateCreditInIPFS(burnedCreditData, `burn_${transferType}`);
}
```

#### Marketplace Controller (`marketplace.controller.js`)
```javascript
// Burn credits and store burn record to IPFS
const burnResult = await CreditLifecycleService.handleCreditTransfer(
  listing.creditId,
  listing.producer.walletAddress,
  buyer.walletAddress,
  quantity,
  'sale'
);

// Update buyer's record - credits are burned, not added to balance
await UserModel.findByIdAndUpdate(buyer._id, {
  totalCredits: currentBuyerCredits, // No change - credits are burned
  creditsBurned: (buyer.creditsBurned || 0) + quantity,
  lastPurchaseDate: new Date()
});
```

### Frontend Changes

#### Transaction Display
- **Burn Status Badge**: Shows "üî• BURNED" for burned credits
- **Credits Burned Counter**: New statistic card showing total burned credits
- **Carbon Offset Indicator**: Shows "‚ôªÔ∏è Carbon Offset Achieved" for burned transactions
- **IPFS Record Link**: Click-to-copy button for permanent burn record hash

#### Buyer Dashboard Updates
```typescript
// New statistics card for burned credits
<div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-6">
  <div className="flex items-center">
    <div className="h-8 w-8 bg-orange-500 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center">
      <span className="text-white font-bold text-sm">üî•</span>
    </div>
    <div className="ml-4">
      <p className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-500">Credits Burned</p>
      <p className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
        {transactions.reduce((sum, t) => sum + (t.creditsBurned || t.credits || 0), 0)}
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## IPFS Storage Structure

### Burned Credit Metadata
```json

## Benefits of Credit Burning

### Environmental Integrity
- **No Double Counting**: Burned credits cannot be resold or reused
- **Permanent Retirement**: Credits are permanently removed from circulation
- **Verifiable Impact**: Immutable IPFS records provide proof of retirement

### Transparency
- **Public Records**: All burn transactions stored on IPFS
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history from production to burning
- **Verification**: Anyone can verify burn records using IPFS hash

### User Experience
- **Clear Status**: Buyers see burn status in transaction history
- **Carbon Offset Proof**: Visual indicators show environmental benefit achieved
- **Permanent Records**: IPFS links provide lasting proof of carbon offset

## API Endpoints

### Purchase with Burning
```http
POST /api/marketplace/purchase
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <buyer_token>

{
  "listingId": "listing-001",
  "quantity": 25,
  "transactionHash": "0x...",
  "paymentAmount": "25000000000000000"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Credits purchased and burned successfully",
  "purchase": {
    "credits": 25,
    "totalCost": 0.025,

  }
}
```

## Testing

### Test Credit Burning Flow

- **Public Verification**: Anyone can verify burn records

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Burn Certificates**: Generate PDF certificates for burned credits
- **Registry Integration**: Connect with carbon credit registries
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track burning statistics and trends
- **API Webhooks**: Notify external systems of burn events

### Compliance Features
